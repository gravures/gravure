==== properties of the moiré pattern ====

* angle
* period
* wave form (profile)
* strength (perceptual contrast)

* order of a moiré
* singular moiré states
* the moiré parameter space
* stable moiré-free screen combinations for colour separation

each printed image can be represented in the image domain by a reflectance function. which assigns to any point (x,y) of the image avalue between 0 and 1 representing its light reflectance: 0 for black (i.e. no reflectedlight), 1 for white (i.e. full light reflectance).
when N monochromatic images are superposed, the reflectance of the resulting image is given by the product of the reflectance functions of the individual images:
	//r(x,y) = r1(x,y) r2(x,y) ... rN(x,y)//

the Fourier transform of the product function is the convolution of the Fourier transforms of the individual functions
	//R(u,v) = R1(u,v) ** R2(u,v) ** ... ** RN(u,v)//
