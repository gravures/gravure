Threshold array generator
=========================

#### Features

* produce irrational angle

* parametric precision for requested angle

* handle production of halfone sets

* stable and consistant lineature between different angle from a set

* control of rosette patern

* 16 bit threshold array

* usage of supercell to produce 12bit halftone depth

* export in postscript ready to use with ghostscript

* incorporate inkjet dot overlap model for minimizing dot gain

* for screenprinting, predict and avoid frequency that will cause moire
  
   between halftone and screen mesh

* parametric minimum dot size
