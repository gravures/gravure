Gutenprint library
==================

## Drop size selection

There are three new settings, Drop Size: Small, Drop Size Medium, and Drop Size Large, that can be used to specify the relative sizes of the three drops.  The screening code assumes that the ratios specified relate to the number of drops of each size that will produce a constant darkness; sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mean that 4 small drops are treated as equivalent to 2 medium drops or 1 large drop.

* The largest drop size you want active should be set to 1. Normally that means the large drop size.  However, if you don't want to use the large drop size (at very high resolution), you may set one of the smaller drops to 1.

* A drop size of 0 is not used.  So if you set the large drop size to 1, the small drop size to 0.25, and the medium drop size to 0, only the small and large drops will be used.

* Drop sizes should be specified in ascending order, other than drops of 0 size.  For example, you should not set the small drop size to 0.5 and the medium drop size to 0.25.  If you do, the results are undefined.

## Light ink value options

These options, which are available for whichever light inks are available on the particular printer, can be used to set the intensity relative to the dark ink.  "Intensity"
means the inverse of the amount of ink required to achieve a particular darkness.  For example, a Light Cyan Value of 0.25 means that the driver will trade off 4 drops of light ink for 1 drop of dark ink.

## Light ink transition options

These options, which are available for each channel with light inks, specify at what point the driver will start using dark ink.  This is expressed as a fraction of the
intensity of the light ink.  For example, if Light Cyan Transition is set to 0.40, the driver will start using dark ink when the amount of light ink reaches 40%.  So and the Light Cyan Value is 0.25, the driver will start using dark ink at 0.1 (6554 on a raw scale of 0-65535).

## Light ink scaling options

These options replace the previous light ink transition options, which basically just adjusted the density of the light ink relative to the dark ink.  I expect that these will be the least useful of the new options, but I may be wrong.

## Raw

if you want to adjust all the settings manually.  In Raw color correction mode, there will be no automatic correction of any kind, including density adjustment.  If you're not careful, you may find yourself using an excessive amount of ink with this setting.  You will need to adjust the Density control or the controls for the densities of the individual colors.  You may want to use this to establish custom densities and ink limits to achieve maximum gamut.

## Density

if you want to use Gutenprint's choice of density, but otherwise have no automatic color correction applied.  This choice of setting should be safe (at least in RGB mode; in CMYK mode it's possible for too much ink to be applied).  This is useful if you're satisfied with Gutenprint's default ink limits, but want to adjust the linearization yourself.

## Uncorrected

if you want to use Gutenprint's choice of linearization, but otherwise have no cross-channel correction applied.  If you're satisfied with Gutenprint's linearization and want to profile the driver, this may be a good selection.

## Devicen

And how to deal with multicolor printers? Do I understand correctly, that there is currently no print mode available, which accepts "DeviceN" input (i.e. one input channel for each ink)?

Yes there is, actually -- see src/testpattern to see how to use it. If someone wants to do N-channel linearization and RGB->DeviceN or CMYK->DeviceN, it will work just fine with Gutenprint (if they have a way of talking to the driver).
