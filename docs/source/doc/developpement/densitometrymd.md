Densitometry
============

Absorbance is a quantitative measure expressed as a logarithmic ratio between the radiation falling upon a material and the radiation transmitted through a material.

$$
A_\lambda = -\log~10~ \left( \frac{I_1}{I_0} \right)
$$

## Standard conditions defined by ANSI

A unidirectional, perpendicular light beam is directed onto the film sample. 
The light that is transmitted through the film is collected, measured, and logarithmically amplified. The densitometer calculates and displays the optical density value.

The optical density values represent the following calculation and relationship to % light transmission.

$$
Optical Density (unitless) =     log10 (     Incident light     ) = (         100         )
$$

$$
Transmitted light = Light transmission (\%)
$$

## Optical Density and Density Range

Tonal values on film are measured in units of optical density.  This normative scale ranges from zero density (0.0d) to 4.0d -- clear film to black.  Density is measured on a base 10 log scale, the numbers represent the tens exponent of the relative density.  A tonal value measured at 2d is 10 times more dense than one measuring 1d.  A one photographic stop difference in density is about 0.3.  For example, 2.5d is about one stop greater in density than 2.2d.  In reality, the sensitivity of film ranges from .3d (fog and film base density) to about 3.7d.  The shorthand for the minimum and maximum value that can register on a film or device is D-Min and D-Max.  Of the two, D-Max is the more important because it is indicative of the ultimate sensitivity of the film or device.

Density range is simply the difference between the minimum and maximum tonal values that the film can register. The theoretical density range of film is then 3.7-.3 = 3.4d, or a bit over 11 stops.  In practice, however, the typical photographer is able to use a fraction of this range.

$$
OD = – log10(T)
$$

$$
T = 10 – OD

## Murray-Davies formula

$$
R_{tot} = a R_{ink} + ( 1 − a ) R_{pap}
$$

where R tot , R ink and R pap denote the total reflectance of the print, the reflectance of the full tone ink and the reflectance of the bare paper, respectively. a denotes the fractional area of the print surface covered by the ink.

$$
R_{tot}^{1/n} = a R_{ink}^{1/n} + ( 1 − a ) R_{pap}^{1/n}
$$

where R tot , R ink and R pap and a are defined as before and factor n is actually a fitting factor, which is determined by experiment.

By using a spectrophotometer we measured the spectra of all these patches. The
Murray-Davies formula was then used to find the effective dot coverage,
